DESCRIPTION
-----------

The xPlatAppx project is an effort to enable developers on a variety of platforms to package and unpackage application packages for the purposes of distribution from either the Microsoft Windows Apps Store, or 2nd/3rd party stores.  To that end, the file format of these packages need to be in a format that is easily digestible to through the Microsoft Windows Apps Store back-end ingestion processes; which means that the file format for these packages will be an .AppX package.
